# University of Pennsylvania Introduction to Python Programming
This is a small project created during my completion of the University of Pennsylvania's Introduction to Python Programming course. The project is a very simple series of function definitions that would assist in managing a banking ecosystem. This project along with the Coursera certificate should serve as evidence of completion of the course and competency in the materials taught.
